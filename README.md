# Calculate-Your-Age
* This repository contains a simple age calculator program for calculating anyone's age.
* I have used HTML, CSS and JAVASCRIPT for building this program.
* Mainly I have used javascript "Date" objects for doing calculation regarding dates, months and years and used basic HTML and CSS for designing purpose.
* In date input box, you can choose your date of birth and hit the calculate button.
* After pressing calculate button, you will see how many years, months and days old you are.
* On selecting invalid dates, it will show some alert.
