# Calculate-Your-Age
This repository contains a simple age calculator program for calculating anyone's age.
I have used HTML, CSS and JAVASCRIPT for building this program.
Mainly I have used javascript "Date" objects for doing calculation regarding dates, months and years and used basic HTML and CSS for designing purpose.
In date input box, you can choose your date of birth and hit the calculate button.
After pressing calculate button, you will see how many years, months and days old you are.
On selecting invalid dates, it will show some alert.
